# Current Authentication Tools ‘Not Compatible With PSD2’

7th Sep 2017 | Written by: [John Basquill]()

**Many existing payment authentication tools, including Apple Pay’s vaunted fingerprint scanning system, will not be compatible with incoming EU security rules, experts have said.**

[Regulatory technical standards](https://paymentscompliance.com/regulation/regulatory-technical-standards-rts) (RTS) on payment security, drafted by the [European Banking Authority (EBA)]() and awaiting final approval at EU level, introduce tough authentication requirements for online transactions.

Although the EBA has softened its stance after initial proposals were met with [industry outcry](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/industry-begs-commission-rework-psd2-standards), research by consultancy giant Accenture has suggested that very few authentication tools currently on the market would be compliant with the standards.

The firm said the only existing systems that would meet the EBA’s requirements force the payer to use two separate devices to carry out an online payment.

“The final draft RTS say five criteria will be used to define [strong authentication]: dynamic linking; independence of channels; identity checking within the bank’s environment; underivable authentication codes; and protection from unauthorised disclosure,” the report said.

“However, the current RTS do not allow for today’s most user-convenient authentication methods, with only those using a separate device qualifying as strong authentication.”

Those requirements are in addition to two-factor authentication, which requires the user to demonstrate two of three possible things: something they know; something they possess; and an inherent characteristic such as a biometric.

Once approved, the standards will form part of the revised [Payment Services Directive](https://paymentscompliance.com/psd2-portal) (PSD2).

Concerns that the EBA’s technical standards were calling for two separate devices as the norm initially arose during discussions on its draft text.

Legal experts [said](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/news_analysis/regulator-appeals-industry-input-controversial-psd2-standards) it was “genuinely unclear how that is supposed to work” for a transaction made on a single device, such as a laptop, smartphone or tablet.

The authority has long emphasised the importance of remaining technologically neutral, however, and confirmed to PaymentsCompliance last year that interpretation was not its intention.

Despite that, Accenture examined a range of existing methods and found faults with most.

Touch ID, which is widely known as a fingerprint-based authentication tool on Apple’s smartphones and which is already used by Apple Pay, meets only one of the five criteria: dynamic linking, which displays details of a transaction to the user.

Authorisation by sending a text message to a mobile phone, known as smsTAN, was adjudged not to operate in two independent channels and did not remain within the bank’s environment.

Security experts have also warned that the antiquated technology supporting text messages could make it an attractive potential avenue for fraudsters to exploit.

Similar flaws were identified in photoTAN, a similar method but where a graphic code is displayed to the user instead of a text message.

Only chipTAN — usually a card reader or similar device — and Bluetooth-enabled dongles fulfilled all five criteria.

If the market is unable to develop new, compliant methods for authenticating payments, Accenture said online retailers would likely bear the brunt.

“Arguably the biggest impacts of the new PSD2 requirements will be on remote e-commerce transactions, with card issuers being obliged to perform a [strong authentication] check for every transaction above €30 that does not meet any exemption criteria,” it said.

In the case of card payments, those exemptions also create a knock-on effect for issuers and acquirers who [must find a way of communicating](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/depth-unanswered-questions-psd2-technical-standards) that a transaction has been authorised.

Other innovators have also said their payment mechanisms will probably have to change, including ride-hailing giant [Uber](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/uber-fears-psd2-standards-will-damage-payment-model).

Under the final draft technical standards, online payments can potentially remain exempt from strong authentication, but only if they keep fraud rates below certain thresholds and if risk analytics are used on each transaction.

That concession was welcomed by most industry participants, but it is [widely agreed](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/tough-fair-eba-stands-strong-authentication-laws) that meeting thresholds will likely prove challenging.

Some have [suggested](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/fraud-exemptions-may-prove-%E2%80%98unworkable%E2%80%99-warn-psd2-experts) strong authentication will have to become the norm for most merchants despite the changes.

In the UK, which boasts one of Europe’s largest online payments markets, further complications could arise around timing.

A dispute between the EBA and the European Commission over third-party account access means the final technical standards have yet to be agreed.

Once the commission has decided on a final text, it must be approved by the European Parliament and Council, and then will not become law for another 18 months.

Arun Srivastava, a partner at Baker McKenzie, pointed out that this could well be after the date that the UK is due to leave the EU.

“The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill will convert European Union laws into UK law to carry across existing EU laws and regulations,” the lawyer wrote in a blog post.

“However, the bill provides that only laws and regulations that have both entered into force and apply before exit day will be converted into UK domestic law.

“If so, this would mean that the RTS on strong customer authentication would not be converted into UK domestic law as under the current timetable the RTS would not apply by exit day.”

The UK has so far confirmed that PSD2 will be implemented in full, but has yet to outline how supplementary EU legislation will be transposed after Brexit.

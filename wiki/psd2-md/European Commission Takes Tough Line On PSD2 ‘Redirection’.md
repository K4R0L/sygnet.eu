# European Commission Takes Tough Line On PSD2 ‘Redirection’

4th Dec 2017 | Written by: [John Basquill]()

**European Commission officials have warned banks that forcing the “redirection” method of customer authentication on third-party providers will likely be non-compliant with the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).**

Banks developing dedicated interfaces to facilitate third-party account access have generally [opted for one of two customer authentication methods](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/%E2%80%98authentication-redirection%E2%80%99-proves-problematic-under-psd2): the pass-through model or the redirection model.

However, the final regulatory technical standards [published by the European Commission last week](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/european-commission-adopts-psd2-technical-standards) cast doubt on whether the latter model would be allowed once the text takes effect — expected to be September 2019.

“We need all actors to play fair,” Philippe Pelle, deputy unit head of the commission’s financial services and payments division, told PaymentsCompliance.

“If dedicated interfaces do not deliver on the expectations of the majority of third-party providers (TPPs), there will be an issue.

“And if redirection is at the source of the problem, that will have to be solved.”

The final standards do not explicitly forbid banks' interfaces from operating a redirect model — where a consumer using a TPP is forwarded to their online banking login screen to input credentials directly.

However, the text did cite that model as a potential barrier to the provision of payment initiation and account information services.

“Such obstacles may include, among others … imposing redirection to the account servicing payment service provider's authentication or other functions,” it said.

Legal experts were surprised by the way that provision was phrased in the final standards.

Fintech regulatory expert John Salmon, a partner at Hogan Lovells, said “the purpose of the examples used is very unclear”.

But according to the European Commission’s Pelle, that line is intended to be taken as “the equivalent of a legal ‘stick’”.

“If it were to be proven that the reason why some dedicated interfaces are dysfunctional is that they are based on a redirection model, banks or the promoters of those dedicated interfaces will have to swiftly review their copy,” Pelle said.

“We hope, however, that the period to come until the date of application of the regulatory technical standards will be used wisely by the relevant market players to develop, in a cooperative spirit, functional (dedicated) interfaces.”

> “We prefer to have recourse to more positive instruments, relying on the goodwill of market players, which hopefully are the majority,” said Philippe Pelle, European Commission.

A [working group](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/commission-backs-industry-project-solve-psd2-disputes) within the Euro Retail Payments Board is expected to agree that banks are not allowed to force third parties to use a redirect model for authentication, in a major report due for publication in the coming days.

The development will likely be cheered by existing third-party providers, many of which have complained bitterly about the prospect of having their customer authentication process defined by banks.

Some cited examples of existing redirect models that are technically faulty, or that do not work on mobile phones.

Other third parties said it is vital they can control the “customer journey” so they can establish a brand presence in a crowded payments market.

But for many banks, use of the redirect model is seen as essential for maintaining security, as it means there is no need for consumers to share their login credentials with a third party.

The UK’s Open Banking Implementation Entity, which has been developing standards for a common dedicated interface across the country’s banking sector, has long favoured the redirect model.

Cornelia Schwertner, head of regulation at prospective third-party provider figo, admitted the decision may not prove popular with banks but welcomed the clarification as “providing a clear end to ongoing discussions on potential interface hurdles”.

“Banks should realise that they are still able to offer any optional redirect authentication solutions for third-party providers, for example,” she said.

The final standards are now undergoing review by the European Parliament and European Council, with officials [confident](https://paymentscompliance.com/premium-content/insights_analysis/commission-confident-lawmakers-will-approve-psd2-standards) they will grant approval to the text.

                                Each online business needs to verify information that has been already verified by

                                As sensitive data is spread across multiple user devices, hacking attempts are
                                unlikely.

                                <strong>Easy to transfer</strong>
                                Personal information is verified only once, and then can be transferred (with your
                                consent) to any online business who needs it.

                                No user profiling is possible without the user being aware of it and giving their
                                explicit consent.

                                <strong>Easy to monetize</strong>
                                Users can be financially incentivized to share their personal data with a third-party.

                            the economic flow between Identity Providers Identity Consumers. But will it not

                            autonomy, as this way Identity Provider can trace his every move?
